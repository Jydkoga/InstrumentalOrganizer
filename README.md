# InstrumentalOrganizer
An easy website to organize your beats!

## Goal:
An easy way to store projects and organize them in terms of genre, bpm, other categories that user makes up.

## The Problem:
Beats get lost and you don't know that you've created them. Oftentimes it's hard to rediscover projects and organize them once you have hundreds of beats.

## The Solution:
By being able to add labels and categorize your projects, you'll be able to easily organize what you've finished, what you still need to work on, and the genres of music you've created.
